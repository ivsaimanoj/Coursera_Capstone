    "An established well-known business man and investor from India, who wants to stay anonymous until an official public announcement, has invited multiple sales, marketing and engineering teams from all over the world to help him in providing with a decision to choose a city in United States or Canada to expand his widely famous and high quality Indian sweets and delicacies manufacturing center. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indian sweets either be it in Canada or United States are being accepted and tasted around the world with all types of cultures and societies, and by opening up this famous manufacturing center it's expected to attract more customers from a global diaspora. Overall, this will be a win-win scenario for both the business and the customers too. Due to their high quality and extremely tasty food items, the customers will get a chance to taste a new variety without travelling the world and the business will benefit from an increased audience outside Indian communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do an experiment, the investor wishes to open up a small food-stall with all the signature delicacies and later expand to build a full size manufacturing unit."
